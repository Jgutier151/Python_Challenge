Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll 

Overview  

This repository contains Python scripts for two data analysis tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. 
These scripts are designed to analyze financial and election data respectively, providing valuable insights into the datasets.  

Repository Structure  

PyBank: Contains files related to the financial analysis task.  
main.py: The main Python script for analyzing financial records.  
Resources: A folder containing the CSV file budget_data.csv with financial data.  
analysis: A folder containing the text file financial_analysis.txt with the results of the analysis.  
PyPoll: Contains files related to the election analysis task.  
main.py: The main Python script for analyzing election data.  
Resources: A folder containing the CSV file election_data.csv with election data.  
analysis: A folder containing the text file election_results.txt with the results of the analysis.  

PyBank Instructions  

In the PyBank challenge, my goal is to analyze financial records to calculate various metrics including total months, net total profit/loss, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.  

Analysis Process

Load the financial dataset budget_data.csv.
Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.
Calculate the net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period.
Compute the changes in profit/losses over the entire period and then calculate the average of those changes.
Determine the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
Determine the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
Print the analysis to the terminal.
Export the results to a text file financial_analysis.txt.

PyPoll Instructions

In the PyPoll challenge, my goal is to modernize the vote-counting process for a small rural town. The analysis involves calculating the total number of votes cast, listing candidates who received votes, determining the percentage of votes each candidate won, and identifying the winner of the election based on popular vote.

Analysis Process

Load the election dataset election_data.csv.
Calculate the total number of votes cast.
Compile a complete list of candidates who received votes.
Compute the percentage of votes each candidate won.
Determine the total number of votes each candidate won.
Identify the winner of the election based on popular vote.
Print the analysis to the terminal.
Export the results to a text file election_results.txt.
